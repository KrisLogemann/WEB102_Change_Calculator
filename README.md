Change Calculator WEB102. Created on May 14, 2019 by Kris Logemann.

Hey everybody, thanks for checking out my code on GitHub.

This webapp is my second project in WEB102 section of my curriculum at San Diego Code School. This is a change calculator, basically you input the amount of whatever the item costs, input how much money was given for said item, and hit calculate. The app will calculate how much change is due and give you the amount in dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and/or pennies.
